                <p>Pavel's journey started at 2015 with C#. Damn it was first sight love he said. Modern highLevel language with garbage collector, fully supported, further developed and the IDE ? No problem there :).

                <p>The labor market is uncompromising. The web is the future. If you like Microsoft technologies, Pavel, so be it - ASP.NET could be your destiny. Before you try to master it you should start code some easy web projects just for practise HTML / CSS / JS and others. You will not regret.
