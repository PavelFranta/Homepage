#HOW TO RUN IT 

1) Download or clone repository.

2) If you don't have node.js, install it ( https://nodejs.org/en/ )

3) Execute following command from your terminal: 'npm install -g @angular/cli'
//now your computer knows what angular is and how to handle it.

4) Open project folder from your terminal and execute another command: 'npm install'
//will check and download all missing libraries and extensions.

5) From project folder execute last command: 'ng serve -o'
//angular cli will assemble and run this project. (flag -o means -open it in my default browser )

bonus) every change what you will do in this project will automatically refresh browser until the terminal with
'ng serve' command is still running.
